    <h1>Personal Diary of Project "HRI in Self-Quarantine"</h1>
    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>Quarantine has been a routine for people who travel between different regions. So we had the idea of designing a human-machine interactive online dialogue bot in response to this situation.</p>
    <h2>Surveying and Brainstorming</h2>
    <p>Due to the current special circumstances, we have had the opportunity to receive feedback from many people who have experienced or are experiencing self-quarantine. Overall there are three important needs:</p>
    <p>1. Random meal pairings that cannot be preferred</p>
    <p>2. Relevant information from sources that are hard to harmonise</p>
    <p>3. Negative emotions that are difficult to overcome</p>
