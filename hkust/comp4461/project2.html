    <h1>Personal Diary of Project "HRI in Self-Quarantine"</h1>
    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>Quarantine has been a routine for people who travel between different regions. So we had the idea of designing a human-machine interactive online dialogue bot in response to this situation.</p>
    <h2>Surveying and Brainstorming</h2>
    <p>Due to the current special circumstances, we have had the opportunity to receive feedback from many people who have experienced or are experiencing self-quarantine. Overall there are three important needs:</p>
    <p>1. Random meal pairings that cannot be preferred</p>
    <p>2. Relevant information from sources that are hard to harmonise</p>
    <p>3. Negative emotions that are difficult to overcome</p>
    <p>So we had a detailed discussion and came up with the most practical and workable solution for these three scenarios.</p>
    <h2>Implementation and Personal Reflection<h2>
    <p>I was focus on the part 3, which is actually about emotional support. But as AI has an inherent weakness in emotional communication, as itâ€™s difficult for reasoning and clustering human emotions due to their complexity, we finally to simulate a small expert system that could guide the user when abnormal emotions were detected.</p>
    <p>But in fact the use of the usability test actually produced many surprises. As most of the people participating in the test were not in self-quarantine or were not in a negative mood, their way of interacting with the system actually did not match my preconceptions. Such that the changes I made later on were in response to other functional needs, such as entertainment recommendations (music, movies).</p>
    <p>I suppose this is because the target audience is hard to find or the scenarios are hard to simulate, but I still think our original set-up makes sense. As we mentioned in the presentation, some of the solutions to negative emotions (such as the HKUST Wellness Center) are actually difficult to be known, and chatbots are a very good way to spread the awareness.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This was my first encounter with the NLP engine and I would find that it was actually much smarter than I thought and could do more than enough, and the training process was quite smooth too.</p>
    <p>So besides the perspective and methodology of thinking about usability testing that the professor brought to the course, I think the experience of using RASA will be a very pleasant surprise for me during this project.</p>
