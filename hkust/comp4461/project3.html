    <h1>Personal Diary of Project "VR Campus"</h1>

    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>Due to a long-standing epidemic, "face-to-face" no longer seems to be an easy thing to achieve in many cases. So it is natural that people are getting used to using technology to keep in touch with friends/family that they cannot get together with. But gradually, perhaps, voice calls and video calls are becoming boring and people will be attracted to a new way of interaction. So we plan to use the hotly developing VR technology to build a solution for this purpose.</p>
    
    <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
    <p>After this we first tested the environment and found many interesting features and functions (e.g. the relative position of users to each other affects the volume of the sound and the position of the sound channel), so we finally decided to use these features to build a platform for online classes.</p>
    <p>We wanted to utilise the characteristics of the platform to design a classroom that would be conducive to group discussions, as this would make communication between people easier and the teacher would no longer have to go into the break-up room one by one to check on the progress of the students.</p>
   
    <h2>Surveying</h2>
    <p>Due to my study schedule, I focused on needs finding and usability testing this time, and find many interesting things.</p>
    <p>Probably because the people I interviewed were all from non-engineering backgrounds, so almost everyone was resistant to this approach at first.</p>
    <p>In addition to this, many of the drawbacks that we discussed within the group that might affect the user experience did not appear in my survey at all, but rather feedback such as "it would be uncomfortable to not have the camera on without facial expressions, but I would be too conscious of my image if the camera was on".</p>
    <p>So we added a lot of additional development requirements after the survey, such as adding technologies like Apple's AR emoji to make interactions more realistic and adding more body movement possibilities.</p>

    <h2>Personal Reflection and Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This project gave me a deep insight into what I had watched in lecture from Steve Jobsâ€™s speech: what technology we have is not the focus of the product, but what experience and change we can bring to the user is the key.</p>
    <p>At the same time I also realised that it is essential to do in-depth surveys of potential users from different backgrounds, otherwise our backgrounds can seriously affect our judgement of product usage scenarios. And the ability to suggest possible solutions to unexpected responses and move the survey forward is very important, otherwise it can easily lead to stalling when the survey is not proceeding as expected.</p>
